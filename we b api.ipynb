    "\n",
    "client server architecture - the client and server are separated allowing them to evolve indpendently\n",
    "\n",
    "stateless - each request sent to the server contains all the information needed to complete the erequest . the server does not maintain any client context between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "cacheable - responses from the server can be cached to improve performance\n",
    "\n",
    "uniform interface - restful services use a uniform interface consisting of resources, heep verbs and hypermedia links\n",

    "layered system. restful services can be composed of muliple layers, allowing for scalability flexibility and security"
